I am a Data science and business analyst intern at The Sparks Foundation.<br>
This repository cotains tasks related to the internship.<br>
We are assigned with 8 tasks out of which we have to complete atleast 3 tasks.<br>
## Task 1: Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
<li>Predict the percentage of a student based on nuber of hours studied.
<li>It is a simple Linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.</li>

## Task 2: Prediction using Unupervised Machine Learning 
<li>From the given 'Iris Dataset' predict the optimum number of clusters.
<li>Represent visually.</li>

## Task 6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
<li>Create a decision tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
<li>The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict right class accordingly.
